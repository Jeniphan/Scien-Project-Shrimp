Controlling the water system using for Crayfish shrimp farming

# About
  Crayfish farming has become very popular in Thai society.
Therefore making shrimp farming become another profession that is widely cultured
Which can generate a high income for shrimp Crayfish, but in shrimp farming, it can not be raised easily.
Controlling the water system is therefore important. Changing the water is one method.
Which can only solve the problem of turbid water
The authors therefore have a research idea on fixing water systems for shrimp farming.
Which is a temperature controller and water change when the water is cloudy Suitable for raising shrimp, Crayfish
And can reduce the difficulty in changing shrimp feed water

# Processing
In this research project Therefore designed and built a water control system for raising Crayfish shrimp
Using an Arduino microcontroller as a processor when Sensor Temperature
Measure the water temperature over 24 degrees Celsius, the machine will adjust the water temperature down to 22.
Degrees Celsius, thus keeping the water temperature always constant. And the principle of changing the turbid water of shrimp feed using Sensor LDR
Measure the light intensity in the water less. The machine will order the Solenoid Valve to change the water in the pond and Sensor LDR.
Can measure light intensity in water a lot The machine will order the Solenoid Valve to stop the system to change the turbid water.
The results of the experiment showed that Time to cool down at 22 Â° C 15 minutes.
The turbidity of the shrimp feed by detecting the light intensity below 97%, the system will change the water.
To create a water system regulator in the shrimp Crayfish.
It can be applied in the shrimp farming industry.
